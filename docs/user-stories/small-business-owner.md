# User Story: Small Business Owner

## Persona: Sarah Chen

**Role**: Owner & CEO
**Company**: TechDefense Solutions LLC
**Industry**: IT Services & Cybersecurity
**Company Size**: 8 employees
**Experience**: 5 years in government contracting
**NAICS Codes**: 541512, 541519, 541330
**Certifications**: Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB)

## Background

Sarah founded TechDefense Solutions 5 years ago after leaving a large defense contractor. Her company specializes in cybersecurity services and IT infrastructure support for government agencies. She currently spends 10-15 hours per week manually searching SAM.gov for relevant opportunities, often missing deadlines or overlooking good matches.

## Goals

1. **Save Time**: Reduce opportunity discovery time from 10 hours/week to 1 hour/week
2. **Increase Win Rate**: Bid on higher-quality matches to improve from 15% to 25% win rate
3. **Never Miss Deadlines**: Get automatic alerts 7 days before response deadlines
4. **Focus on Core Business**: Spend more time delivering services, less time searching
5. **Grow Revenue**: Increase annual contract revenue from $2M to $5M

## Pain Points

- **Manual SAM.gov Search**: Tedious, time-consuming, error-prone
- **Information Overload**: 200+ opportunities per day, 95% irrelevant
- **Missed Opportunities**: Discovers good matches after deadlines pass
- **Inconsistent Evaluation**: No systematic way to score opportunities
- **No Tracking**: Uses spreadsheets, loses track of opportunities in pipeline
- **Decision Fatigue**: Struggles with bid/no-bid decisions

## Success Story

The AI recommendations are incredibly accurate - we've doubled our bid rate while improving our win rate from 15% to 25%. In the first quarter using GovAI, we added $2.1M to our pipeline and won three contracts totaling $720K. The ROI is phenomenal, but the real value is getting my life back. I can finally focus on running my business instead of endlessly searching SAM.gov."
